meteorToDoList
==============

This is my first try at making a simple ToDo app in Meteor.js or any language or framework for that matter.

I have some other ideas for Meteor.js apps, but I figured it was probably a good idea to nail down some basics by making the classic 'todo' app.

For kicks, you can see a live version of the app at: andyroo2000-todo-list.meteor.com
